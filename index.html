			<strong>Greeting fellow citizens of the Daggerfall Covenant.</strong>
			Do you desire to stain the snow with Ebonheart blood? To storm the Aldmeri Pact on the open battlefield? Are you a master crafter looking for a home? If you answered yes to any of the above the Ghosts of the Covenant want you to join the ranks of Nocrtunal's army. If you wish to storm enemy keeps to raise the Daggerfall flag and work within a team to become an elite fighter then look no further, you have found a home.
